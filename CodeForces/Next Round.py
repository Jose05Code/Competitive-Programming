    This function counts how many participants will advance to the next round.

        n (int): Total number of participants
        k (int): The k-th place score threshold

    Logic:
        - The k-th place score is determined by the score of the participant in the k-th position.
        - A participant advances if their score is greater than or equal to the k-th place score and is greater than 0.
